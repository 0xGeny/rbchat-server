I want to hire a high skilled art designer who can design some parts of my new website.
My idea is to save foods all over the world.
1. Over 1/2 of food supply is wasted.
2. 1/3 of this wasted food is rescuable.
I need two animations for these and now I already have the first one.
Who can help me design the second one?
